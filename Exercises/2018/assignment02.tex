%\problem
%Show that the recursion 
%$T(n) = 8 \cdot T(n/2) + \theta(n^2)$, with the initial condition $T(1)=\theta(1)$,
%has the solution $T(n) = \theta(n^3)$.

\problem
Describe an algorithm that multiplies two $n$-bit integers in time $O(n^2)$. You may assume to have a subroutine $Sum(d,e)$ which returns the sum of two $n$-bit natural numbers $d$ and $e$ in time $O(n)$.
 
\problem Suppose $a,b \in \N$ are two $n$-bit integers, where $n$ is a power of $2$. Consider the first and the last $n/2$ bits of $a$, and denote their corresponding decimal numbers with $a'$ and $a''$, respectively. Likewise decimal numbers $b'$ and $b''$ correspond to the first and the second half of the bit-representation of $b$. 
  \begin{enumerate}[i)]
  \item Show that $a = a' + a'' \cdot 2^{n/2}$ and  $b = b' + b'' \cdot 2^{n/2}$.
  \item Show that $a \cdot b = a' \cdot b' + (a' \cdot b'' + a'' \cdot b') \cdot 2^{n/2} + a'' \cdot b'' \cdot 2^n $. 
  \item Carefully derive from this  that two $n$-bit
    numbers can be multiplied by resorting to three multiplications of
    $n/2$-bit numbers and $O(n)$ elementary bit operations.
  \item Conclude that two $n$-bit
    numbers can be computed in $O(n^{\log_2(3)})$
    elementary bit operations.
  \end{enumerate}
  
\problem 
The \emph{determinant} of a matrix $A \in \R^{n \times n}$ can be computed by the recursive formula 
\begin{displaymath}
  \det(A) = \sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^{1+j}a_{1j} \det(A_{1j}),
\end{displaymath}
where $A_{1j}$ is the $(n-1)×(n-1)$ matrix that is obtained from $A$ by deleting its first row and $j$-th column.  This yields the following recursive algorithm (see the lecture notes, Example 1.4). 

\begin{tabbing}
  Input: $A \in \R^{n \times n}$ \\
  Output: $\det(A)$ \\
  
  {\bf if} \= $(n=1)$ \\
           \> {\bf return} $a_{11}$ \\
  {\bf else} \\
           \> $d:=0$  \\
           \> {\bf for } \= $j=1,\dots,n$ \\
           \>            \> $d:= (-1)^{1+j}⋅ \det(A_{1j}) +d$\\
           \> {\bf return} $d$   
\end{tabbing}

Let $A \in \R^{n \times n}$  and suppose that the $n^2$ components of $A$ are pairwise different.
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item
Suppose that $B$ is a matrix that can be obtained from $A$ by deleting the first $k$ rows and $k$ of the columns of $A$. How many (recursive) calls of the form $\det(B)$ does the algorithm create? 

\item How many different submatrices can be obtained from $A$ by deleting the first $k$ rows and some set of $k$ columns? Conclude that the algorithm remains exponential, even if it does not expand repeated subcalls. 
\end{enumerate}
  
\problem Given a random $n \times n$ matrix $M$ where each entry is i.i.d. variable taking the value $1$ or $-1$ with the equal probability $1/2$, show the following: 
\begin{equation}
Pr\left[\det(M)=0 \right] \geq (1-o(1)) n^2 \frac{1}{2^{n+1}} 
\end{equation}

\problemstar Let $M_{2^k}$ be a matrix of order $n:=2^k$, where $\ k \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$ such that it is recursively defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
M_{2^k}=
\begin{pmatrix}
    M_{2^{k-1}} & M_{2^{k-1}} \\ 
    M_{2^{k-1}} & -M_{2^{k-1}} 
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
and $M_1=[1]$. Prove that $|\det(M_{n})|=n^{n/2}$, i.e. that the Hadamard bound is tight.
